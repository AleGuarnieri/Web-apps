## Installation and Prerequisites

To install the flask app, you need:
- python3
- python packages in the requirements.txt file
 
 Install the packages with
``` 
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Motivation

This is an interactive flask app built as part of a Data Science course to learn how to
visualize and deploy a dashboard on a web app, using data directly from an API.
The app visualizes data from the Open Brewery API: data is pulled directly from the 
API and then visualized using Plotly after preprocessing.

## Details
To run the app, open a terminal, and go into the directory with the flask app files. 
Run `python breweryapp.py` in the terminal and then visualize the app on the web at 
http://localhost:3001
